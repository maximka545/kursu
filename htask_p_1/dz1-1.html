    <h3 align="center">My favorite song</h3>
    <p>This ain't a song for the broken-hearted <br>
      No silent prayer for faith-departed <br>
    </p>
    <p>And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd <br>
    You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud <br>
    </p>
    <p>It's my life <br>
    It's now or never <br>
    But I ain't gonna live forever <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br>
    (It's my life) <br>
    My heart is like an open highway <br>
    Like Frankie said, "I did it my way" <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br>
    It's my life <br></p>
    <p>Yeah, this is for the ones who stood their ground <br>
    For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down <br></p>
    <p>Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake <br>
    Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks <br></p>
    <p>It's my life <br>
    And it's now or never <br>
    I ain't gonna live forever <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br>
    (It's my life) <br>
    My heart is like an open highway <br>
    Like Frankie said, "I did it my way" <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br>
    'Cause it's my life <br></p>
    <p>Better stand tall when they're calling you out <br>
    Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down <br></p>
    <p>It's my life <br>
    And it's now or never <br>
    'Cause I ain't gonna live forever <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br>
    (It's my life) <br>
    My heart is like an open highway <br>
    Like Frankie said, "I did it my way" <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br></p>
    <p>And it's now or never <br>
    I ain't gonna live forever <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br>
    (It's my life) <br>
    My heart is like an open highway <br>
    Like Frankie said, "I did it my way" <br>
    I just want to live while I'm alive <br>
    'Cause it's my life <br></p>
